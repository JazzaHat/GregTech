Too many people die every day of starvation, after foolishly abandoning their food to avoid the treacherous INVENTORY_FULL. For this reason, our top researchers have spent up to 63% of your tax money to produce the Portable-Organizational-Arranging-Saturator-9000, also known as a Potato-On-A-Stick. With the POAS, you can now carry your food and your sticks in the same stack. We try to keep the methods of production a secret, at least until the patent office recognizes our invention (they keep turning us down). Unfortunately, a libertarian among our staff went rogue and published the methods of production <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Potato-on-a-Stick/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
