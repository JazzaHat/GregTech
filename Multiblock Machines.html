Many of the more advanced industrial processes involved in GregTech cannot be done in a single block machine. For these processes, Greg developed the GregTech 100% Lagfree Multiblock Machines. Their name comes from the interesting fact that, unlike most other multiblock structures, only one block (the control block) is a TileEntity, and the multiblock itself is not an entity. All other blocks in the machine are plain blocks. All Multiblock Machines consist of a control block (the Machine itself), and a &quot;machine hull&quot;, a (usually) hollow structure made out of some combination of Machine Casings, Reinforced Machine Casings, or Advanced Machine Casings. Many Multiblock Machines can share some or all of their Hulls, allowing for cheaper construction of large numbers of them.<br />
The GUIs of Multiblock Machines show level-by-level plans for how they are constructed.<br />

<a class="wiki_link" href="http://gregtechcommunitywiki.wikispaces.com/Bronze+Blast+Furnace">Bronze Blast Furnace</a><br />
<br />
The Bronze Blast Furnace is the first Multiblock Machine you should make. It allows you to cook Iron Ingots with Coal, Charcoal, or Coal Coke, and receive Steel Ingots. It is the primary way of acquiring steel in early GregTech. It is, however, very slow, requiring several minutes to cook each Ingot.<br />
Unlike other Multiblock Machines, the Bronze Blast Furnace does not require Machine Casings. In stead, it uses Bronze Plated Bricks.<br />
Crafting it requires a large number of Bricks and a very large number of Bronze Plates. It is recommended that you not construct one until after you have your basic Steam infrastructure (<a class="wiki_link" href="Small%20Coal%20Boiler.html">Small Coal Boiler</a>, <a class="wiki_link" href="Steam%20Smelter.html">Steam Smelter</a>, <a class="wiki_link" href="Steam%20Powered%20Forge%20Hammer.html">Steam Powered Forge Hammer</a>) set up. It is however recommended that you construct several of them, to allow you to process large amounts of Steel at a time and to compensate for the slow production rate.<br />
The Bronze Blast Furnace is required to advance, as all Electric machines and generators are dependent upon Steel.<br />
Multiple Bronze Blast Furnaces can share their side or back walls, allowing for reduced construction costs.<br />

<a class="wiki_link" href="http://gregtechcommunitywiki.wikispaces.com/Industrial+Blast+Furnace">Industrial Blast Furnace</a><br />
<br />
The Industrial Blast Furnace is the core of the GregTech tech tree. It is the only machine with multiple upgrade paths and flexible Machine Casing requirements, and the only machine that must be upgraded to continue up the tech tree. It initially only allows you to create Steel and Iron, but when constructed with higher quality Machine Casings, allows you to continue up through Aluminium, Chrome, Titanium, Stainless Steel, and eventually Tungsten and Tungstensteel.<br />
The I. Blast Furnace can make Steel from Iron more quickly than the Bronze Blast Furnace, but consumes large amounts of EU to do so. Even if you have an I. Blast Furnace, you should keep your Bronze Blast Furnace(s) running, as they do not consume EU and the I. Blast Furnace cannot use Charcoal.<br />
The Industrial Blast Furnace's hull is constructed in such a way that 4 Industrial Blast Furnaces can be placed and run on a single hull.<br />

<u><a class="wiki_link" href="Implosion%20Compressor.html">Implosion Compressor</a></u><br />
<br />
The Implosion Compressor is a mid-game Multiblock Machine used where the over 4000 Gibbl of the regular Compressor is not enough. The Implosion Compressor is capable of compressing Gem Dusts into their original Gems, including Diamond Dust to Industrial Diamonds. It is also used to compress Coal Chunks to Industrial Diamonds, and Iridium Alloy Ingots to <span style="color: #00c0ff;">Iridium Reinforced Plates</span>.<br />
Unlike all other Multiblock Machines, the Implosion Compressor accepts and consumes only 32EU/t. In stead, all of its recipes consume large quantities of Industrial T.N.T. Additionally, all Implosion Compressor recipes produce a number of Dark Ashes equal to 1/2 the I.T.N.T. consumed.<br />
Because of this additional resource cost, it is recommended that you stockpile I.T.N.T. if you intend to make a large batch of Industrial Diamonds or Iridium Reinforced Plates.<br />

<a class="wiki_link" href="http://gregtechcommunitywiki.wikispaces.com/Industrial+Grinder">Industrial Grinder</a><br />
<br />
The Industrial Grinder fills the same role as the Macerator, smashing Ore blocks into Crushed Ore. However, the I. Grinder produces Purified Crushed Ores rather than Dirty Crushed Ores, and additionally produces up to two by-products per Ore block. These by-products can be changed by using different fluid catalysts in the grinding. Otherwise, the Grinder requires a supply of Water.<br />
The I. Grinder is not always the most efficient machine to process Ores with, but it is usually. See the Ore Efficiency Analysis linked to on the I. Grinder page for more information.<br />
The Industrial Grinder's hull is constructed in such a way that 4 Industrial Grinders can be placed and run on a single hull.<br />
Note that constructing an Industrial Grinder requires the use of either a Vacuum Freezer and an Industrial Blast Furnace capable of reaching 3000K, or an Implosion Compressor. (Go for the Implosion Compressor, it's easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
<u><a class="wiki_link" href="Vacuum%20Freezer.html">Vacuum Freezer</a></u><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Vacuum Freezer is a late-game GregTech Multiblock Machine. It is expensive to construct and energy-intensive to run, but can quickly freeze Water Cells into Ice Cells or completely cool Nuclear Reactor Cooling Cells. It also allows for the crafting of Heating Coil Upgrades and the use of Tungsten and Tungstensteel, by cooling the Hot Metal Ingots produced by the I. Blast Furnace.</span><br />

<u><a class="wiki_link" href="Distillation%20Tower.html">Distillation Tower</a></u><br />
<br />
The Distillation Tower is a multiblock machine that has the function of a Buildcraft Refinery, with the difference that it consumes EU instead of MJ and is a lot more efficient when it comes to materials, giving many different byproducts.<br />
However, it is the second most expensive multiblock structure in the mod, (only behind the Fusion Reactor) consisting of many Highly Advanced Machine Casings so it should be one of the last machines you should make.<br />
<br />
The Distillation Tower is an EU-consuming multiblock version of the Buildcraft Refinery. It is capable of producing Diesel (Fuel) Cells from Oil Cells and Ethanol Cells from Biomass Cells. What makes it useful is that each of its recipes produces several by-products, making it produce significantly more energy than a Buildcraft Refinery would.<br />
The Distillation Tower is, however, the second most expensive Multiblock Machine in GregTech. (Only the <a class="wiki_link" href="Fusion%20Reactor.html">Fusion Reactor</a> is more expensive.) If you can get up to it though, it is worth it.<br />
