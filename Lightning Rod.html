Lightning strikes occur randomly when it is raining or thundering. Lightning strikes are <span style="line-height: 1.5;">4x more common in a thunderstorm than in rain.</span><br />
The Lightning Rod has an internal storage of 100 million EU, and does accept <a class="wiki_link" href="Covers.html">Covers</a>.<br />
<br />
In order for this block to function, it must have a pillar of Iron Fences on top of it. The chance for lightning strikes to occur is proportional to the total number of fences used, and the height of the highest fence. So, the highest probability of lightning strikes would be if the Lightning Rod was placed at bedrock level, and the Iron Fence pillar extended to the top of the map. Make sure there are NO blocks above the fence pillar. (Like a solar panel, the Rod checks if it can see the sky.)<br />
<br />
The Lightning Rod outputs at a rate of 8192 EU/t (Quad-EV). It will attempt to output EU from all 4 of its sides. Attaching 4 HV Transformers and downgrading the voltage to HV (16 x 512 EU/p) is generally recommended. Alternatively, as the Matter Fabricator can accept 8192EU/p, a Matter Fabricator can be directly connected and fed using a Lightning Rod.<br />
<br />
Note: Forestry and Ars Magica have means of forcing rain in the world. This can be used to artificially generate more lightning strikes. A Mystcraft age with the Lightning symbol works for this as well.<br />
Note 2: The Lightning Rod code checks for the server's weather state (Rain/Thunder/none) when running its lightning strike calculations. This means that, while certain mods like Extra Bees or Modular Powersuits may have ways of causing lightning to strike in specific places, these will NOT trigger the Lightning Rod.<br />
<br />
Trivia:<br />
<ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">As soon as Weather was announced for Minecraft, back in Beta, people started clamouring on the IndustrialCraft forums, asking Alblaka to add a Lightning Rod. This suggestion was denied multiple times over that anyone who suggested it was declared a n00b, and sentenced to be impaled and toasted upon the lightning rod for the glory of the Almighty Dragon Lord. (And banned.) And then in the summer of 2012, for Minecraft 1.2.5, GregoriusT came in and actually made one. Hilarity ensued.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">In the time since inventing the Lightning Rod, GregoriusT has witnessed more thunderstorms in real life than he has in Minecraft.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">When lightening rods were added originally, they were useful, but as Gregtech progressed and balance became a factor, slowly became more and more pointless with the price far out-stripping their actual usefulness. They function as a bragging right better than an actual power source unless outside factors (ie other mods) make thunderstorms more common.</span></li></ul><br />

 <span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif;">You may think &quot;What the Fuck is a Lightningrod?&quot;, I will answer your Question: A Lightningrod is a Device, which uses the Power of Thunderstorms, to convert them to usable Electricity. I produced it like this:</span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif;">Due to the high Voltage of Lightning and limited Space, I wasn't able to integrate additional Transformers, to convert the Energy down, to a normal Niveau. So you get 8192 EU/t after one single Strike (until the Supercondensator is empty).</span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif;">But Gregorius, my Cables cant handle that amount of Energy!</span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif;">Well, Downtransformation is your Problem, i added four EV-Slots to the Rod, then you can convert it to 4x 2048 EU/t using HV-Transformers.</span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif;">And now, how to get it to work for you: 1. Install it 2. Get a Lightningrod 3. Get a bunch of Ironfences 4. Make a large Tower on top of the Rodblock with the Ironfences 5. Make sure, that there is absolutely NO BLOCK above that Tower! 6. Place 4 HV-Transformers at the Sides of the Rod, before you connect it to your E-net. 7. Wait for a Storm. 8. ...? 9. Profit!</span><br />
<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif;">We are not responsible for people, who get impaled/toasted on the Lightningrod. And we are also not responsible for any damage, which is caused by Quad-Extreme-Voltage.</span>
