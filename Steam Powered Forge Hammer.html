The Steam Powered Forge Hammer is a bronze age low-efficiency <a class="wiki_link" href="Plate%20Bending%20Machine.html">Plate Bending Machine</a>.<br />
<br />
This device hammers two ingots into one plate. Due to 50% material cost efficiency, this machine is made obsolete once a Metal Former or a Plate Bending Machine is constructed and powered.<br />
<br />
Construction of this machine is not strictly necessary to graduate from the bronze age to the steel/electrical age, but it will speed construction of a <a class="wiki_link" href="Bronze%20Blast%20Furnace.html">Bronze Blast Furnace</a> by reducing the time and hammering costs of making <a class="wiki_link" href="Covers.html">Bronze Plates</a>.<br />
<br />
Build Order Recommendation: Before <a class="wiki_link" href="Steam%20Smelter.html">Steam Smelter</a> and <a class="wiki_link" href="Bronze%20Blast%20Furnace.html">Bronze Blast Furnace</a>
