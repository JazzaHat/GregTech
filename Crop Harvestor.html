<em>&quot;Harvests the Cropsticks and Logs in front of it&quot;</em><br />
<br />
The <strong>Crop Harvestor</strong> is a machine for automatic harvesting of your Crops, in particular, IC2 Cropsticks. When the plant in front of it reaches maximum growth, the Crop Harvestor will automatically harvest it (as a right-click would). The produced items are only picked up by the Harvestor if they fall in the block it is facing.<br />
Items are stored internally and can be ejected through the Red output side, or removed by <a class="wiki_link" href="Covers.html">Conveyor Modules</a> or Pipes.<br />
<br />
Cost per Crop harvested: 100 EU<br />

The range of the Harvestor can be increased by installing Overclocker Upgrades. Each Overclocker Upgrade doubles its range (1x OC means 2 tiles, 2x OC = 4 tiles, 3x OC = 8 tiles, 4x OC = 16 tiles).<br />
Up to 4 Overclocker Upgrades can be installed.<br />
Unlike in conventional machines, each Overclocker Upgrade increases the energy required for each operation by x4. This means that at 4 Overclocker Upgrades, each crop harvested consumes 25,600EU, and would require Battery Upgrades to even be carried out.<br />
<br />
Via its GUI, it can be told whether or not to automatically output items and EU (through the Red side), or whether to emit a Redstone Signal when its inventory is occupied.<br />
