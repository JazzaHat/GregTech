The Large Gas Turbine is a multiblock construction to burn Hydrogen and Methane to produce EU more efficiently than the single block <a class="wiki_link" href="Gas%20Turbine.html">Gas Turbine</a>.<br />
<br />
It's construction is similar to the <a class="wiki_link" href="Large%20Steam%20Turbine.html">Large Steam Turbine</a>, with the difference that it is made of Reinforced Machine Casings instead of standard, and it requires (or will require) a Muffler Hatch for pollution instead of an Output Hatch for water.<br />
<ul><li>All corner edges of the hollow 3x3x4 (exterior dimensions) structure are made of Reinforced Machine Casings (28 of the Steel ones)</li><li>The 3x3 faces must have the Large Gas Turbine block or Dynamo Hatch facing outwards</li><li>The remaining 4x3 faces (2 blocks per face) can have any configuration of Input Hatches, Muffler Hatches, and Maintenance Hatches. You must have at least one of each of these, but multiple Input Hatches could be useful.</li><li>Any remaining holes can be plugged with Reinforced Machine Casings</li></ul>
