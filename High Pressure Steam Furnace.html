&quot;Smelting things with compressed Steam&quot;<br />
Steam Capacity: 16 Buckets<br />
Steam may be piped in any direction except the front.<br />
Like most steam machines, the exhaust vent must face a block of air for the machine to perform more than one operation. The exhaust vent may be repositioned with a wrench. Upon completing an operation, a dangerously hot puff of smoke will come out of the vent. This will deal 12hp (6 hearts).<br />
Every tick it uses 12 Liters of steam.<br />
Operations last 6.4 seconds.<br />
In comparison with the <a class="wiki_link" href="Steam%20Furnace.html">Bronze Steam Furnace</a>, the Steel Steam Furnace takes 3x the steam but .5 the time.
