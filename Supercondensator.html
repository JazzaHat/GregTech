The <strong>Supercondensator</strong> is GregTech's Tier V-VI Transformer block. It can accept up to 1 Million EU/p, and scale it down to 32,768EU/t. (Prior to 1.6.2, the Supercondensator would transform down to 8192EU/t.)<br />
<br />
It was originally implemented to store the energy created by Lightning Rods, and to handle the energy outputted by early Fusion Reactors. Since the Fusion Reactor rework, Supercondensators have seen little use. However, with the E-Net overhaul in 1.6.2, Supercondensators may once again see the light of day, as the arrays of Plasma Generators that modern Fusion Reactors can supply output well above the 8192EU/t limit of Glass Fiber Cables.<br />
<br />
If given a Redstone signal, the Supercondensator will, akin to a vanilla IndustrialCraft Transformer, begin accepting lower-voltage energy and outputting energy in packets of 1 Million EU. Note that the only two blocks that can accept 1M EU/t: Superconductor Wire, and Supercondensators. So, converting up to 1M EU/t is only really useful if you have a LOT of energy to move, and you absolutely need to run it down 1 cable.<br />
<br />
The Supercondensator can store up to 10 Million EU internally, but will accept Battery <strong>Upgrades.</strong> As it is already Tier 5-6, and is itself by Transformer by definition, it does not accept Transformer Upgrades.<br />
<br />
The best way to handle the output from this block is to place multiple EV Transformers adjacent to it, to convert its 32768EU/t down to a more manageable number, like 8192EU/t
