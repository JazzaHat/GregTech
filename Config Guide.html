GregTech is notable for having some of the longest and most detailed configuration files of any mod. Its config files are so long and detailed that there are actually three of them, and they have their own folder (minecraft/config/GregTech/). As such, each configuration file will receive its own page.<br />
The three config files:<br />
<strong>1. BlockItemIDs.cfg</strong><br />
This one is pretty much exactly what its name says. If you have a block or item ID conflict that throws a crash, this is where you could fix it on the GregTech end.<br />
<strong>2. GregTech.cfg</strong><br />
This file contains the settings core to GregTech, those that are not affected by other mods.<br />
<strong>3. DynamicConfig.cfg</strong><br />
This is the really big one. DynamicConfig contains configuration options for every single recipe GregTech adds. It is called DynamicConfig because it changes itself to reflect your mod list, as GregTech adds many recipes to itself based on what other mods you have.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong><strong>:</strong> Because of Greg's tendency to change things under the hood, every time GregTech updates, you may need to re-generate one or more of your config files. If you change a line in the config files and it does nothing, most likely that config line is deprecated, and you will need to re-generate that file. Keep backup configs.<br />

<h1 id="toc0"><a name="x1.6.2"></a>1.6.2</h1>
 GregTech in 1.6.2 is being built against IC<span style="font-size: 80%; vertical-align: super;">2</span>'s Experimental builds. This section will contain a complete copy of freshly generated config files for GregTech 4.07w<br />
<ul><li>BlockItemIDs.cfg</li><li>GregTech.cfg</li><li>DynamicConfig.cfg</li></ul><br />
<br />
<h1 id="toc1"><a name="x1.5.2"></a>1.5.2</h1>
 This section will contain a complete copy of the freshly generated config files for GregTech 3.11. There will be two copies of DynamicConfig.cfg, to show the differences: one with no mods installed other than IndustrialCraft, GregTech, and NEI, and one taken from the Feed The Beast Unhinged pack (as an example of how this file can change with differing mod lists).<br />
