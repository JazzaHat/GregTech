    <div class="wiki" id="content_view" style="display: block;">
This is my view on how it is most resource-efficient to progress in GregTech as of version 4.03. I mainly optimize resource usage but often also time. The less time you spend on farming stuff the faster you can progress.<br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">I'm assuming players have turned off all copper, tin, lead and silver ore spawns in world and only use what things GT provides. If you have the other ores turned on things won't change much but you'll have a LOT more ores and saving them won't make much point. I also ignore dungeon drops and villager trades but both can greatly speed up the progress.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">___</span><br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc0"><a name="x-Caveman-era"></a>Caveman-era</h2>
 <br />
<ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Wooden tools</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Stone tools</span></li></ul><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">You can make flint tools as well. They are as good as stone, just twice the durability. Handy to save inventory space, especially with the durability nerfs to Wood and Stone tools</span><br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc1"><a name="x-Iron tools"></a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Iron tools</span></h2>
 <br />
As GT has changed the way most tools are created things start to get a bit tricky from here on.<br />
<ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">First you need <a class="wiki_link" href="Tools.html#x-Hammers">hammer</a> and <a class="wiki_link" href="Tools.html#x-Files">file </a>to start creating other tools</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Get <a class="wiki_link" href="Tools.html#x-Saws">saw</a></span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Get iron pick to start mining <a class="wiki_link" href="Ores.html">ores needed</a> to make bronze.</span></li></ul><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Technically you don't need the saw but as it means you need to cut down half the logs for planks and quarter of logs for sticks it's generally a good time saver. The extra time to find the 4 ingots neede will be made up by the time you save from having to grow/cut less trees.</span><br />
<br />
As you mine pick up any iron as well, you'll be needing a LOT of it down the line. Pay attention that not all biomes contain all ores. In addition most ores don't spawn on the diamond level so you can't just stripmine at level 1-16 and get diamonds together with the other needed metals. Furthermore, certain ores even spawn more abundantly if you are mining them well above what would be the normal mining range. (Specifically, this includes Cassiterite and Tetrahedrite being able to spawn between levels 70 and 120 in the correct biomes.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc2"><a name="x-Bronze tier"></a>Bronze tier</h2>
 <br />
Unlike real-world in GT apparently bronze comes after iron.<br />
Bronze is basically steam age. You can craft basic machines that create or use steam to do various tasks that you are already familiar with from earlier IC2.<br />
<br />
<ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Boiler + grinder (useful byproducts from ores)</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Steam powered forge hammer (no more hammers spent on making plates)</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Furnace </span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Smelter (Really useful for bronze production)</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Blast furnace, start cooking a TON of steel. Note you can also use charcoal there and not only coal.</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Compressor &amp; extractor in preparation for electric tier</span></li></ul><br />
Sturdy Grinder grinds Ores into Dusts, producing 1 Dust and occasionally 1 byproduct Dust of whatever ore you put in.<br />
<br />
Steam Powered Forge Hammer uses two ingots to make one plate, just like you can do in a crafting grid. The machine also costs quite a lot (<span style="line-height: 1.5;">at minimum 4 bronze plates, 16 iron plates and 8 iron rods -&gt; 8 bronze ingots and 40 iron ingots). For that amount of metal you can create 1 1/3 bronze and 6 2/3 iron hammers. In total they have enough durability to craft 298 plates. While this sounds like a lot, a single bronze Blast Furnace takes 100 plates and you'll be making a metric ton of plates before you can start using the lossless electric plate bender.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Furnace is useful for saving on fuel. You'll need a LOT of coal and/or charcoal for steel later on. If you have turned off burning wood to charcoal without coke oven you'll want to save as much of it as possible as it takes 4 per ingot of steel and you need two ingots per plate. Meaning a stack of (char)coal is enough for just 8 steel plates.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Smelter is basically a time and fuel saver as it allows you to smelt tin and copper ingots directly into bronze. Without it, the most efficient way of creating Bronze is to smelt Cassiterite to Tin, grind it to Dust, grind Tetrahedrite to Dust, smelt the Dust to Copper, grind the Copper to Dust, mix the Tin and Copper Dusts, and smelt into Bronze. With smelter you can skip grinding tin and copper to dust, and directly smelt the Copper and Tin Ingots together.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Blast Furnace can only have a single furnace block, unlike the electric one that can take one per side. Additionally, it consumes 4 Coal per Iron per Steel, and takes a LONG time to smelt Steel. You are looking at several real-life hours to get enough Steel to build the first electric machines and several days to get an Industrial Blast Furnace going. If that's too long time to wait, build more than one Blast Furnace.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Compressor and Extractor don't really have uses in the Bronze tier, but they are required to make the upgrade to the Steel/Electric tier.</span><br />
<br />
I suggest using GT (bronze) fluid pipes to connect the Steam Boiler with the rest of the machines. You can attach your machines directly to the boiler, but it limits you to 4 machines per boiler as the front face of boiler doesn't output steam and one face needs to be free for letting out the excess Steam when you can't use it.<br />
<br />
With pipes you need to consider that the pipes always split the things in them at each intersection. I had one line of pipes coming from the boiler and had the later-stage processing machines (steam hammer, smelter) closer to the boiler and early-stage ones (furnace, grinder) further away. That meant I could dump a bunch of stuff in them and the later-stage stuff would finish first instead of getting a ton of dusts and no real plates or bronze.<br />
<br />

 <br />
As soon as you have a few bronze machines up and running you can craft yourself a bronze jackhammer and power it without needing any steel. Trick is that redstone works as single-use battery worth of 800 EU when inserted in batboxes. It's generally a good idea to get one ASAP as you'll have a pretty fast tool for breaking stone + you'll save on metals. Only downside is you'll need to feed it quite a bit of redstone. To get it you'll need quite a few copper cables and some tin cables. That means you'll need to have bronze extractor to turn resin into rubber. Once you have that just build a batbox and the jackhammer itself.<br />
<br />
Some math:<br />
It has 10k EU capacity and uses 50 EU per block it breaks. One redstone gives 800 EU. With one charge it can break 200 blocks (bronze pickaxe can break 256, iron 128). It takes 12.5 redstone dust to get one full charge.<br />
