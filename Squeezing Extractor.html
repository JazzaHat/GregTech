<em>&quot;Steam Powered Extractor&quot;</em><br />
<br />
<strong>*1.6.2 machine</strong>*<br />
<br />
Sticky Resin can no longer be cooked in a Furnace to produce Rubber. To create the Rubber required for construction of your first Electric Machines, you will need a Squeezing Extractor. The Squeezing Extractor turns certain items into Rubber Pulp, which is then turned into rubber by smelting it in a furnace.<br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">This Extractor functions the same as the <a class="wiki_link" href="Automatic%20IC%C2%B2%20Machines.html">Automatic Extractor</a>, but operates on Steam rather than EU.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Steam for this machine is most likely to be supplied by a <a class="wiki_link" href="Small%20Coal%20Boiler.html">Small Coal Boiler</a> or a High-Pressure Steam Boiler.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">For reference, obtaining Rubber in the Squeezing Extractor can be done by:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">1 x Rubber Sapling/Rubber Wood --&gt; 1 x Rubber Pulp</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">1 x Slime Ball --&gt; 2 x Rubber Pulp</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">1 x Sticky Resin --&gt; 3 x Rubber Pulp</span><br />
<br />
The Extractor requires to be supplied Steam via piping to any of it's sides. However, be aware that this machine, as with all Steam Machines, has a square Vent which will eject a jet of steam after each work is finished, the adjacent tile to this Vent needs to be unobstructed in order for the machine to keep operating. Also, it'll burn you if you're there. Steam vent can be adjusted using a <a class="wiki_link" href="Tools.html#Wrench%20in%20world">Wrench</a>.<br />
A common problem with Steam machines is that they will run one process, then inexplicably stop. This problem is caused by the Vent being obstructed.<br />
