The Universal Macerator is an advanced version of the Macerator which is capable of producing byproducts, making it the intermediate between the Macerator and Industrial Grinder and on the same level as Thermal Expansion's Pulverizer. As its recipe requires Stainless Steel and Titanium, it is better to rely on the Sturdy Grinder or Pulverizer to gain secondary products until it becomes feasible to upgrade to the Universal Macerator (as upgrading and EU usage are the only major distinctions between the Uni and its predecessors).<br />
