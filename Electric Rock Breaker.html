<em>Electric cobblestone generator MK IV</em><br />
<br />
The <strong>Electric Rock Breaker</strong> is a machine that has been in GregTech for a very, very long time. It is an industrial cobblestone or obsidian generator. When placed with one water block and one lava block adjacent to it, and a constant supply of EU, it will produce an infinite supply of Cobblestone and automatically export it out its red side, as per standard GregTech automation practices.<br />
If the lava block is on top, the Electric Rock Breaker will produce stone, instead of cobblestone.<br />
If given a supply of Redstone Dust, it will convert Redstone Dust into Obsidian, instead of generating cobble. (This was something that could happen in Vanilla Minecraft at one point, and Greg decided to keep it and industrialize it.)<br />
As most of GregTech's electric machines, it will auto output items to the red side.<br />
