Since version 2.90d, almost all GregTech machines can accept upgrades.<br />
If a machine can be upgraded, its tooltip will contain the label &quot;Possible Upgrades:&quot; followed by a series of letters, reflecting the upgrades the machine will accept. Not every machine can accept every upgrade.<br />

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Upgrades are installed by holding the Upgrade item in your hand, and right clicking the machine you want to upgrade.</span><br />
Machines that accept upgrades can only accept 16 upgrades total.<br />
Overclocker and Transformer upgrade items in inventory stack up to 4. (configurable)<br />
Some upgrades are crafted at a crafting table, while some must be crafted via the Assembling Machine (Assembler).<br />
Upgrades cannot be removed once installed. [This can be bypassed for automatic machines, by enabling the conversion to IC² machines in the config.]<br />
Machines, when wrenched and retrieved as items, will retain their upgrades, and their tooltips will state the installed upgrades.<br />
The GregTech Portable Scanner can also show what upgrades a machine has installed.<br />

*vanilla IC² upgrade<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> As of version 4.03d, all EU storage upgrades above most basic 10k, have 10x their original values. So, Energy Crystal and Lithium Battery store 1M, Lapotron Crystal stores 10M, and Energy Orb stores 100M EU. This is based off of a change made in IC2 Experimental that created an additional tier between the Batbox and MFE.<br />
There is no limit on how many of each individual energy storage upgrade can be installed to a machine (except for the 16 upgrade total cap).<br />
Energy stored in the different storage types (EU, MJ, Steam) cannot be inter-converted, and machines will only output EU. However, if a machine contains MJ or Steam, it will consume them before it starts consuming EU.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Higher tier EU storage upgrades can only be applied if the machine has enough Transformer upgrades.<br />
For example, in order to accept an Energy Crystal upgrade, the machine must be able to accept HV.<br />
In order to accept a Lapotron Crystal upgrade, the machine must be able to accept EV.<br />

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Unlike the energy storage upgrades, each machine is limited to having:</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">4 Overclocker Upgrades</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">2 (LV machine) or 1 (MV machine) Transformer Upgrades</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">2 HV-Transformer Upgrades</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">1 Pneumatic Generator Upgrade <strong>- Doesn't actually allow MJ support anymore</strong></span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">1 Steam Upgrade</span></li></ul><strong>Note:</strong> <span style="line-height: 1.5;">If a machine is overclocked too much, it may require more EU/t than its default storage capacity. To compensate for this, add an Energy Storage upgrade.</span><br />
<strong>Note 2:</strong> 4 Overclocker Upgrades will increase a machine's required EU/t to 256x its original value. So, a 4x-overclocked Blast Furnace would consume 32,768EU/t.<br />

<br />
Utility Upgrades can each be used once per machine.<br />
<br />
As of v4.04a, Kanthal and Nichrome ingots were added, and the Heating Coil recipes were transferred to the Wiremill. Previously, Kanthal Heating Coils were crafted with <span style="line-height: 1.5;">3 (Refined) Iron Ingots, 3 Chrome Ingots, 3 Aluminium Ingots -&gt; 3x Kanthal Heating Coils, and Nichrome Heating Coils were crafted with 4 Nickel Ingots and 1 Chrome Ingot. If Railcraft was installed, both of these recipes took place in the Rolling Machine.</span><br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">In Gregtech version 4.06c, more annoying sounds were added to machines. These sounds are rather loud and annoying after a while, but can be turned off on a machine by putting a Muffler Upgrade on the machine. Items with sounds like the Debug and Portable Scanner have sounds which can't be stopped.</span><br />
