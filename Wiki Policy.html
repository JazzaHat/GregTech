As a contributor to this wiki, you agree to abide by these rules:<br />
<br />
<ol><li><strong>Do not post outdated information.</strong> This especially applies to copying information over from other wikis. please verify that your information is consistent with the most recent version before editing</li><li><strong>When making major changes to a page's format, post on the discussion page.</strong> Just a simple explanation of what you are doing, and why you think it is better than the current format will suffice.</li><li><strong>Keep your pictures small.</strong> We have a limited storage space on this wiki, and though we are not currently in any danger of running out, this could be a concern in the future. Furthermore, we want to be accommodating to people with slower computers and smaller monitors. Bear in mind when taking pictures, that not everyone has a high-resolution computer. As a general rule, about 12 cm or 5 inches on a side should be the maximum, preferably less, though exceptions can be made for particularly important pictures.</li></ol>
