What do you think?","replies":[{"user":"PaladinOne","created":"2013-09-17T00:46:30-07:00","body":"All of the GT generators are stated to store 1M EU... The only three where that actually gets relevant though are the MEConverter, MEAbsorber, and Plasma.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIt might be worthwhile to check the minimum and maximum values for their internal buffers, because all the generators will only buffer so much energy, and for whatever reason they like to keep a little energy in their internal buffers."},{"user":"CurlyH","created":"2013-09-17T00:48:36-07:00","body":"Fair enough, is it possible to check it with the debug scanner?"},{"user":"PaladinOne","created":"2013-09-17T01:17:58-07:00","body":"Yeah, I got my information via debug scanner.  First saw an oddity with the MEA, with it keeping 512EU stored internally for no readily apparent reason."}]}
