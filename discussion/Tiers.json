Have one page for each Tier, listing properties of the tier and machines in that tier, and then have one page for each machine, describing the functions of that machine across all tiers.<br \/>\nThe sidebar itself could be laid out with a 'Tiers' section, containing links to the (7?) Tier pages.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWe may also need to segregate the wiki into 1.7 information and 1.6 information, what with how many things are changing."},{"user":"TheOnlyQueue","created":"2014-04-21T12:57:33-07:00","body":"I wish we could directly edit CSS and HTML on wikispaces... it would be so much easier."}]}
