I've seen factories built underground. Rather cliched to have a subterranean factory, with help from a BC Quarry.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWhich is why I would like see some factories built on the surface. Assuming you use normal worldgen specs, what are the best designs for factories in your opinion?","replies":[{"user":"Chocohead","created":"2014-02-07T11:16:15-08:00","body":"Fully expandable ones, limiting it to the walls is a bad idea"},{"user":"TheN1K0L4Z","created":"2014-02-22T10:38:24-08:00","body":"Of course! But that approach means re-designing the blueprints. How can you annex to a ready-made solution in .pdn or .psd format?<br \/>\n<br \/>\nUnless. . . BINGO! Plot your zones for future development! This approach can actually work. Assuming you know how to use Minutor."}]}
