The aim of this topic is to deliver a documentation that is vital to resource management. Assuming you have built a pulverizer (Thermal Expansion) or a Quartz Grindstone (Applied Energistics). This database is for you.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe material listings for each machine are organized by tier and it's important to read the prerequisites towards the next tier of machines. Just because you made every machine in that tier, doesn't do justice towards the next. You may need to visit the Nether, several times for glowstone or other resources. You will need to visit the End for resources, too. But do NOT jump ahead or it will punish you badly!<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAs for the cheat sheets, I'm still working on the First Tier. I need help though. Answer me this, what machines belong to the first tier as of 1.4.7?","replies":[{"user":"PaladinOne","created":"2014-01-26T16:26:24-08:00","body":"That is a really, REALLY old mod pack...
