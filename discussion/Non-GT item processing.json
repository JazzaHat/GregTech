Electrolyzer, and will add one for the Chemical Reactor (BTW could someone add it to the sidebar? I dont know how).<br \/>\nShould I add in all the processing for PFAA ores, Twilight forest ingots, etc?  The lists could quite possibly be longer than the lists native to IC2\/GT... Should they have their own tables on the pages?","replies":[{"user":"SpwnX","created":"2014-02-14T06:52:05-08:00","body":"To add pages on the sidebar you have to tag them, click ... (more options), add tag, put the same name as the sidebar one. For example the Chemical Reactor needs a &quot;Processing&quot; Tag, I'm gonna add it."},{"user":"Fluttershy9","created":"2014-02-21T15:48:51-08:00","body":"Okay.  And recipes?  E.G. PFAA ore processing or elements are useless without PFAA, the IBF now accepts partially processed ores at a higher cost, etc."},{"user":"PaladinOne","created":"2014-02-24T22:02:13-08:00","body":"This might be a good idea for all the pages, but the I. Centrifuge page has its recipes separated by category, and the I. Grinder page has its recipes separated by what mod adds the ore.  Feel free to add additional recipe lists like that (and actually it might be a good idea).<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAs a follow-up point, on the Materials page, if we could determine the Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and (if applicable) Quaternary products of every material (like with ground ores) it would be good to have that centralized.<br \/>\n(I remember at some point, Greg mentioned that every material in his list has several by-products listed with it.)"}]}
