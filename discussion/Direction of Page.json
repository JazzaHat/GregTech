I was worried that having a huge chart of recipes would get in the way of more important information, though I suppose that belief was somewhat unfounded.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAnd ILGT, If you are going to do something like this again, please post about it on the discussion page beforehand, so we know what you are doing and why."},{"user":"SpwnX","created":"2013-05-31T12:21:41-07:00","body":"I've already written this on  IC\u00b2forum but writing again is not bad :<br \/>\nEach of you make a &quot;desktop&quot; page, so you can freely edit it without any problems.
