For example, clicking on Utility would bring up a page similar to <!-- ws:start:WikiTextUrlRule:0:http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Category:Aviation_in_art --><a class=\"wiki_link_ext\" href=\"http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Category:Aviation_in_art\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Category:Aviation_in_art<\/a><!-- ws:end:WikiTextUrlRule:0 -->. I don't know anything about running wikis but it should be as simple as changing a few words from a category-template page.","replies":[{"user":"PaladinOne","created":"2014-02-26T18:36:17-08:00","body":"I did that for the Bronze Steam Machines, but I'd need to poke around with the wiki architecture a bit to make the tabs actual buttons."},{"user":"PaladinOne","created":"2014-02-26T18:54:27-08:00","body":"... Providing that's actually possible; I think the tab buttons might be limited just to tags"},{"user":"Chocohead","created":"2014-02-27T08:36:54-08:00","body":"Each tab is every page which has a tag with the same name as the tab. Your idea could still work though"}]}
