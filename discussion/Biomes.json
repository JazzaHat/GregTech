Also, I've got a slight confussion here, I assume they're Vanilla + OPlenty + XLBiomes? Perhaps we could make a table out of it and include this fact, lest you'll be looking Donut Hills not finding any.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSidetracking, and this one is for Paladin, good edit on the Bauxite, I see the criteria now &lt;__&lt;","replies":[{"user":"PaladinOne","created":"2013-09-19T04:26:46-07:00","body":"The Biome lists would make the most sense if broken up by Vanilla, Highlands, BoP, and EBXL, and then possibly alphabetized.  I like the idea of a table, as a way of dividing those 4 lists.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nA universal table covering all ores and all possible biomes for them makes a bit less sense in my head, but could still be doable and useful (but probably more confusing to look at)"}]}
