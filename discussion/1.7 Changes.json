I don't see a good way,, rather than changing the pre to have *outdated* in the title and linking them to in the new page full of 1.7 info, where we say &quot;use this if you are playing pre 1.7&quot;. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nAnyone got any other ideas?","replies":[{"user":"TheOnlyQueue","created":"2014-04-29T17:35:21-07:00","body":"Start with just a page called 1.7. Get stuff down, and refine it until release.
