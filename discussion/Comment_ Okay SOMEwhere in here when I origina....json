{"page":"Small Coal Boiler","page_id":"164163120","rangeText":"The Small <u>Coal<\/u> Boiler takes its name seriously; it can only be run off of Coal, Charcoal, Coal Coke, and Lignite. It will not accept any other burnable items, including Coal\/Coke Blocks.<br \/>\nOne piece of Coal or Charcoal will last 96 seconds. One piece of Coal Coke will last 384 seconds. One piece of Lignite will last 24 seconds.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWhile there is fuel burning in the Boiler, the Heat Bar will increase. <span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;\">When the Heat bar reaches full, the Boiler starts to consume fuel much more slowly. This means that, except for long periods of inactivity, it is more fuel efficient to keep it fully heated even when not using it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.5;\">In a fully heated Boiler, one piece of Coal or Charcoal will last about 6 minutes. One piece of Coal Coke will last about 24 minutes. One piece of Lignite will last about 72 seconds.<\/span>","share_type":"comment","created":"2014-05-22T23:04:43-07:00","createdBy":"PaladinOne","title":"Comment: Okay SOMEwhere in here when I origina...","description":"Okay SOMEwhere in here when I originally wrote or re-wrote this page, there was a massive miscalculation.
