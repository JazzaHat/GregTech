I noticed that you can use Lignite Coal &quot;Gem&quot; as fuel in a GT Coal Boiler, but I haven't the original mod this item comes from. So my question is: is it there any use for Lignite Coal Dust or Lignite Coal Plate in GT without the mod Lignite Coal comes from? Thank you.","replies":[{"user":"Chocohead","created":"2014-02-07T13:57:12-08:00","body":"Kinda, they will still work as a fuel, you just won't be able to make it.
