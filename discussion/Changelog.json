We could also pretend that GT 5.00 starts from scratch, and say something like:<br \/>\n<br \/>\nGT 5.00 ALPHA<br \/>\nAdded X<br \/>\nAdded Y<br \/>\nAdded Z<br \/>\n<br \/>\nJust listing everything that exists currently (this would be a worst case thing)."},{"user":"gigas2897","created":"2014-06-13T10:42:48-07:00","body":"Well, I started looking for where Greg could have possibly started posting what added, but the fact is that he doesen't say which version is which..."},{"user":"Chocohead","created":"2014-06-14T08:22:14-07:00","body":"New plan, I'll work backwards from the 5.0y update post"},{"user":"Chocohead","created":"2014-06-14T09:45:07-07:00","body":"It's done. It only took an hour, and the changelogs from 5.00e are patchy and probably partly wrong, but it is done. <br \/>\nGregtech leaves alpha texture update (5.01a)"}]}
