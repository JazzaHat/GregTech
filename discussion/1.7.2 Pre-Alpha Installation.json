Well, my problem is that installing the last version of IC2 Experimental (#478) and the recommended version of Forge (10.12.1.1060) plus GT 5.00v my game doesen't even start. It gets stuck at the &quot;Mojang&quot; screen and I only have installed these three mods. With only IC2 and Forge the game runs perfectly. Can someone help me and probably a lot of people that for laziness just don't wanna ask, please ? Thank you.","replies":[{"user":"gigas2897","created":"2014-06-11T23:50:51-07:00","body":"Ok I solved it. First, I dedicated more memory to Minecraft, and later I noticed Greg told with his peculiar calm that you have to wait a few minutes for the first installation due to the creation of configs. If it is there any noob like me I hope this helped!"},{"user":"Chocohead","created":"2014-06-12T09:20:08-07:00","body":"Yeah, the config generation is very slow. You can watch the files change size as they are made and edited."}]}
