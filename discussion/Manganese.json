I just can't find it in the overworld. I read on internet that you can find tungstate ore in black granite veins, but for now I didn't found it in granite. Is tungstate very rare or is it there an other way to get manganese (except for red garnet)? I can't craft stainless steel. Thank you","replies":[{"user":"Chocohead","created":"2013-12-29T08:17:03-08:00","body":"You can get it from the end but it's pain to kill the ender dragon just for it. There should definitely be some tungstate ore in some black granite veins as the granite veins are pretty big and the spawn rates aren't that bad."},{"user":"gigas2897","created":"2013-12-30T13:23:49-08:00","body":"Then how did you get stainless steel in your game, if you did? Looking for tungstate in granite clusters?"},{"user":"Chocohead","created":"2013-12-30T13:25:33-08:00","body":"Dungeon chests seem to have manganese in reasonable amounts, since it is only 1 manganese for 9 stainless steel. But tungstate in black granite your best bet if you don't find many dungeons."},{"user":"okaolias","created":"2013-12-30T14:56:47-08:00","body":"You get manganese from tungstate in black granite, loot in chests, or all over the end. You can take your pick, but no one ever said it would be easy.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nI mean, seriously, it's just supposed to be hard :-["},{"user":"gigas2897","created":"2013-12-30T15:14:46-08:00","body":"Thanks guys, I just wanted to know if there was some faster way to get it. Anyway, I'm not surprised that manganese is so hard to find. Darn, this is GregTech, where even crafting of sticks has been nerfed. It's challenging, and I like it."}]}
